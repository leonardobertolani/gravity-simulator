## GRAVITY SIMULATOR
This Java program simulates simples objects gravitating around each others, using the Newton's law of gravitation.

The program is mainly composed of three parts:
* the **left panel**, used to control the simulation process. It is made up of buttons for starting and stopping the simulation, and for adding new planets.
* the **central window**, that actually displays the simulation.
* the **right panel**, used to access the information of a single planet, modify it or trace its orbit. 

Here are some screenshots of the project:
